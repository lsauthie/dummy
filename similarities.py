'''
Compute similarities among a list of strings.
For each value, identify all similar values in the list. This is done with an standard integrated loop. We try to match similarities between 
a source and a target in the same list - once a similarity is found, the target is pruned (with '-1').
One target can only be similar to one source (this is controlled with the INT value in the tuple (i,0)) - '-1' is a match, '>0' hast x matches.
Return = {string1:[(string2,simvalue1),(string3,simvalue3)], string5:[]}
